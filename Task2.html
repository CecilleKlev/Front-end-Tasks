<!--
    Consider these urls as inputs to a function you will make 
    
const urls = [
'https://www.example.com/public/12765/assets/images/thumbs/5/40_40/image1.jpg',
'https://www.example.com/private/assets/76345/images/thumbs/12/42_46/image2.jpg',
'https://www.example.com/protected/assets/images/35678/thumbs/100/35_40/image3.jpg'
]

You function should parse all the urls and return this as a result
const output =[12765, 76345, 35678]
