<!--
    Consider the following DOM
    
<body>
    <div id="content">
        <span>Some text</span>
    </div>
</body>

A new element: <div id="newElement"></div> will be appended in the div id content at a random time after
the page load. The time can be between 1-1800 seconds.

Your task is to change the text color of the span element with content "Some Text"
to red when the new element has been spawned on the page.
